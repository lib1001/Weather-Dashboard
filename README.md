# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

This web application is a weather app that allows users to search for weather by a city, and that displays the current weather and the five day forecast.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To start using this application, a user enters a city into the search bar, then clicks on the search button. That city's current and five day weather forecast will appear on the page, and that city will be listed as a button under the search bar. To look at another city, simply repeat the process with a new city. If the user wishes to return to a previous search, clicking on that city's name from the list will take the user back to that city's weather page. 
Each time a city is selected, an image representing the weather, the current date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index will be displayed. The UV index value will be highlighted to represent the safety range that it falls under.
